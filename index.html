								<h1>About Me</h1>
							</header>

							<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Header.PNG" alt="" /></a>

							<p>I am a Colorado native with an innate curiosity and a passion for learning and discovery. I have a Bachelor’s Degree 
							in Psychology from the University of Colorado, Boulder as well as the basic and advanced Google Career Certificates in 
							Data Analysis. My pursuit of a career in Data Analytics is motivated by my affinity for statistics and my passion for combining 
							an analytical mindset with data to solve problems and gain unique insights. 
							</p>
							
							<header>
								<h3>Undergraduate Degree and Research Experience</h3>
							</header>

							<p>During my studies as an undergraduate student, I developed a deep interest in data and how data can be used to develop 
							an informed understanding of human behavior. Some of my favorite courses included Statistics and Research Methods, which 
							covered topics such as data collection, analysis, experimental design, hypothesis testing, and statistical programming. 
							My interest in these topics motivated me to seek out an undergraduate Research Assistant position in the Emotion, Decision, 
							Judgement, and Identity (EDJI) lab on campus. Through this lab, I had the opportunity to work on a project about political 
							bias in helping behaviors for an Honors Thesis. I worked with a graduate student from the lab to help design the experiment, 
							collect data, analyze the data, and communicate findings. This experience culminated in a thesis paper and defense presentation. 
							</p>

								<h3>Entering the Field of Data Analytics</h3>
							</header>

							<p>I discovered the field of Data Analytics while researching career opportunities after completing my final season as a 
							Whitewater Raft Guide and River Manager. The idea of interacting with and analyzing data to help organizations make informed, 
							data-driven decisions appealed to me instantly. I enrolled in and completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate program through 
							Coursera. This program built upon my foundational understanding of statistics, data, and analysis and allowed me to develop 
							industry-specific skills such as using relational databases and writing queries in SQL. I then proceeded to complete the Google 
							Advanced Data Analytics Certificate, which further expanded my understanding of data and introduced me to new topics relating to 
							data science and analytics. These topics include advanced statistical tests, exploratory data analysis, basic machine learning, 
							and programming in Python. I am looking to apply my undergraduate background and research experience in conjunction with technical 
							data skills acquired from the Google Career Certificates to obtain a Data Analytics position.
							</p>

								<h3>Whitewater Raft Guide and River Manager Experience</h3>
							</header>

							<p>During my summers as an undergraduate, I worked as a Whitewater Raft Guide in Cañon City, Colorado. Whitewater Rafting allowed 
							me to develop skills that have proven useful in many facets of my life. I learned how to learn and adapt quickly to new 
							environments and to think quickly and decisively in adrenaline-inducing situations. I developed skills pertaining to working on a
							team with others, whether it was coordinating with other raft guides, or encouraging teamwork and cooperation among my paddle crew. 
							</p>

							<header>
							</header>
							
							<p>After graduating from the University of Colorado, I accepted the position of River Manager. The River Manager is largely 
							responsible for day-to-day operations and logistics, guide staff, addressing customer issues and complaints, and ensuring all 
							equipment and facilities are in proper condition. This role allowed me to become competent at communicating effectively with 
							others and working in a leadership position. It bolstered my problem-solving and decision-making abilities as well as my ability 
							to work with stakeholders to address issues and meet organizational goals. During the off-season, I was tasked with organizational 
							and recruitment responsibilities in addition to my responsibilities as manager. 
							</p>

							<header>
							</header>

							<p>My other hobbies include rafting, hiking, camping, and playing board games and video games with friends.</p>
